we are doing computer vision project since 2023 and mostly our projects are based on CNN, YOLO series and also used arduino for the mediapipe
currently we've done 3 projects which are based on CNN(RESNET-50) and YOLO
we did brain tumor detection by YOLOv5n, v8n, v11n
and we did small proeject related to smart farm
also we did face emotional change recognition, our test data is live data receiving via webcam, we were able to recognize and our highter accuracy was up to over 90%
and we are analyzing time series data and abstract its result by graph so we were easily get to know the changing of human emotion when someone face to some kind of situation 
also we were get to know how nervous he/she is or they are
 as brief i beg your pardon, we've been stepping in AI field since aug, 2023 so you may find some logical error 
if you want you can read our pptx and anytime you can leave your opinion , i will be grateful cuz your opinion and advise gonna be the power of our skill for the development and enhancing
